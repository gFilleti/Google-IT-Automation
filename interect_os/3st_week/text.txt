The rain in Spain falls mainly in the plain!

This text is a test to finde some numbes, e-mails, etc:


Numbers 
After ten, eleven (11), twelve (12), thirteen (13), fourteen (14), fifteen (15), sixteen (16),seventeen (17), eighteen (18), nineteen (19),
and twenty (20) follow.These numbers are seen less in grocery stores, as most prices are 10 dollars or less;
it is however worth knowing these numbers, generally and, in terms of grocery shopping, for when the bill must be paid. 
 
After twenty, numbers such as twenty-five (25), fifty (50), seventy-five (75), and one hundred (100) follow. 
So long as one knows the core number, or the number situated in the tens or hundreds position that determines 
the general amount, understanding these more complicated numbers won't be difficult. 
For example thirty-three (33) is simply "thirty" plus three; sixty-seven is "sixty" plus seven; 
and sixty-nine is simply "sixty" plus nine.
