Hello dear manifest

My day was beatifull as it wars dark
The shinny moon fear of dark
By the shadow of sun I lay the bark

My fear of nothing was filled
by the incresing night
as the day rises I was tired

Last day last night
All was alone
as my days passed

As a pool in the sun
Shallow by the silence
Fear of nothinless
